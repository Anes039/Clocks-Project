 	 			<p>Acknowledged both for the aesthetic appeal of its models and for its technical excellence, CORUM is proud to contribute to perpetuating the time-honored values and expertise of Fine Watchmaking. Since 1955, CORUM has adopted creativity and boldness as its guiding principles. It is pursuing the path traced by the founders, more loyal than ever to the iconic collections, while enriching them with a powerful modern touch bearing the hallmark of innovation and technical breakthroughs. The continuity and the longevity of its collections are not mere words at Corum: the Admiral has been sailing the oceans for 60 years, while the Bridges collection has been making its mark on watchmaking history for over 40 years. History is definitely in the making at Corum. </p>
